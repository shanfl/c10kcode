<h1>Class Usage in the FTP Benchmark Code</h1>
In general, there is no inheritance among the classes, and all
allocations are static.  (Exceptions to this rule are noted below.)
<p>
The benchmark program 'bench' instantiates a bunch of
ftp_client_pipe_t's using the utility function robouser_t::static_init(),
which keeps them in the static array roboclient_t::s_users[].
<ul>
	<li>bench
	<ul>
		<li>Sked
		<li>robouser_t
		<ul>
			<li>static ftp_client_pipe_t &nbsp;&nbsp;s_users[robouser_MAXUSERS];
			<ul>
				<li>int m_cfd;  // control socket
				<li>int m_dfd;  // data socket
				<li>nbbio &nbsp;&nbsp;m_obuf;
				<li>nbbio &nbsp;&nbsp;m_ibuf;
				<li>ftp_client_proto_t &nbsp;&nbsp;m_proto;
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

In other words, 
<ul>
<li><a href="bench.cc">bench</a> instantiates Sked, and uses but doesn't instantiate robouser_t,
<li><a href="robouser.cc">robouser</a> has an array of ftp_client_pipe_t's,
<li><a href="ftp_client_pipe.h">ftp_client_pipe_t</a> has two nbbio's, one ftp_client_proto_t,
and two socket descriptors,
<li><a href="nbbio.h">nbbio</a> doesn't have any objects in it.
<li><a href="ftp_client_proto.h">ftp_client_proto_t</a> doesn't have any objects in it.
</ul>
The one instance of dynamic memory allocation is the array of
ftp_client_pipe_t's, roboclient_t::s_users[].  Its elements are
dynamically created by roboclient_t::static_init().  Note that
this means just about everything is on the heap, but there's very little
heap activity - once they're allocated, that's it.
<p>
None of the classes has constructors that do very much.  To avoid heap fragmentation,
the classes stay allocated, and init() and shutdown() methods are used to
grab resources (e.g. file handles) as needed.
<p>
There aren't many pointers to objects; these include roboclient_t::s_users[],
the pointer to Sked passed to robouser_t::static_init() and used in robouser_t::start(), and
the pointer to the ftp_client_pipe_datainterface_t passed in to ftp_client_pipe_t::init().
<p>
There are two instances of inheritance so far-
anything that uses ftp_client_pipe_t must inherit from and implement ftp_client_pipe_datainterface_t,
and anything that uses Sked must inherit from and implement SkedClient,
That's how the caller is notified that ftp data is waiting, or that a previously scheduled event is occurring.
These are two examples of an <a href="callbackDemo.html">object-oriented sort of callback function</a>, 
also known to the Design Pattern crowd as the Observer pattern.
