/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Simple example of object-oriented callbacks using the Java-inspired
 approach of an "interface", i.e. a pure virtual class with a single
 member function.
 Compiles, but doesn't run; some functions are omitted.

 In C, a function which needs to call its caller repeatedly before returning 
 often takes a callback function pointer and a context pointer as parameters,
 then calls the callback with the context pointer as an argument.
 The context pointer is there so the callback function doesn't need to 
 look at global variables to get at its data.

 You can do the same thing in C++; the calling object can pass a pointer
 to itself as the context pointer.  Writing in C++, you'd like the
 function to be a member of some object.  It turns out the nicest way to
 do this is to ask the caller to inherit from a very small pure 
 virtual class (an 'interface', in Java terms) and pass you a pointer to it.  
 Your function uses it as a pointer to the interface, and 
 just calls the one method it cares about.

 This feels very natural to me -- and I'm a hardnosed C programmer.
 I think of it as a nice way to express the combination of
 "function pointer plus context pointer" in a typesafe way.
 The call is a bit more expensive, since it has to do several memory
 references to look up the overloaded virtual function, but hey, 
 this is C++, what's a few CPU cycles between friends.

 This technique is, according to the C++ FAQ author, an expression of
 the very core of dynamic binding, object-oriented code.
 See the archived discussion at bottom of this document.

 In Java parlance, this technique is simply called using an Interface.
 (Java, having stripped out all but the best bits of C++, can use
 simple names for what's left :-)

 In "Design Patterns" parlance, this technique is called the 
 "Observer Pattern".  See Amazon's reviews of that book at
 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612</a>

 and the Patterns home page at <a href="http://hillside.net/patterns/">http://hillside.net/patterns/</a>
 Brace yourself - people who like "Design Patterns" have a lot to say
 about the subject.

 Note that templates can sometimes be used to achieve a 
 similar effect without the runtime overhead of the virtual function lookup.
 Some people prefer one approach, some prefer the other.

 Subject: object-oriented callbacks

 Hi!
 http://www.cerfnet.com/~mpcline/c++-faq-lite/pointers-to-members.html
 seems like it ought to mention a few more callback techniques.

 One very common in Java is:
 when you want an object-oriented callback,
 ask the caller to inherit from a very small pure
 virtual class (an 'interface', in Java terms)
 and pass you a pointer to it.
 See http://www.kegel.com/ftpbench/callbackDemo.cc
 for an explanation and example.

 Another one is functors (which I don't quite get yet,
 maybe I'm already doing them).

 Subject: Re: object-oriented callbacks

 Callbacks is described in the sections on inheritance.  The OO term is
 "dynamic binding" but the effect is the same: old code can call new code.

 Re functors, let's start describing a "functionoid."  A functionoid is an
 object that has one major method.  It's basically the OO extension of a
 C-like function such as printf().  One would use a functionoid whenever the
 function has more than one entry point (i.e., more than one "method") and/or
 needs to maintain state between calls in a thread-safe manner (the C-style
 approach to maintaining state between calls is to add a local "static"
 variable to the function, but that is horribly unsafe in a multi-threaded
 environment).

 A functor is a special case of a functionoid: it is a functionoid whose
 method is the "function-call operator," operator()().  Since it overloads
 the function-call operator, code can call its major method using the same
 syntax they would for a function call.  E.g., if "foo" is a functor, to call
 the "operator()()" method on the "foo" object one would say "foo()".  The
 benefit of this is in templates, since then the template can have a template
 parameter that will be used as a function, and this parameter can be either
 the name of a function or a functor-object.  There is a performance
 advantage of it being a functor object since the "operator()()" method can
 be inlined (whereas if you pass the address of a function it must,
 necessarily, be non-inlined).

 This is very useful for things like the "comparison" function on sorted
 containers.  In C, the comparison function is always passed by pointer
 (e.g., see the signature to "qsort()"), but in C++ the parameter can come in
 either as a pointer to function OR as the name of a functor-object, and the
 result is that sorted containers in C++ can be, in some cases, a lot faster
 (and never slower) than the equivalent in C.

 Since Java has nothing similar to templates, it must use dynamic binding for
 all this stuff, and dynamic binding of necessity means a function call.
 Normally not a big deal, but in C++ we want to enable extremely high
 performance code.  That is, C++ has a "pay for it only if you use it"
 philosophy, which means the language must never arbitrarily impose any
 overhead over what the physical machine is capable of performing (of course
 a programmer may, optionally, use techniques such as dynamic binding that
 will, in general, impose some overhead in exchange for flexibility or some
 other "ility", but it's up to the designer and programmer to decide whether
 they want the benefits (and costs) of such constructs).

 Thanks for your explanation of functors, it's quite clear.
 May I quote you in my page?  I already link to your FAQ.

 Is there a name for a pure virtual functionoid that's meant to
 be an interface specification for a user-defined class,
 a la Java interfaces?

 Marshall Cline wrote:

 The pattern I'm describing is a way to have a library function call
 user code repeatedly.
 That may simply be old code calling new code, but it's seen from
 the point of view of a programmer trying to solve a particular problem,
 which might be more accessable than a full description of dynamic binding.

 Your FAQ-lite doesn't mention any of this stuff, except in the most
 general terms, AFAICS.  Perhaps you reserve this for your
 printed FAQ?

 Subject: Re: object-oriented callbacks

 Yes you can quote me regarding functionoids and functors (I'll probably add
 that stuff to the FAQ at some point, but in the mean time, feel free to
 quote me).

 But please don't confuse functors (or functionoids) with interfaces/abstract
 classes/inheritance/dynamic binding/call backs.  Most functors, for example,
 have neither base classes nor derived classes - most are stand-alone
 concrete classes.

 Regarding "having a library function call user code repeatedly," this is a
 good thing, and it is the essence of object-orientation and dynamic binding.
 It is, to be sure, a somewhat specific application of OO design, but the
 underlying approach (of having the user code in a derived class that gets
 called by existing code that has base class pointers) is the heart and soul
 of all OO designs.

 In this sense the FAQ actually spends a great deal of time on this general
 pattern.  In fact, it is not only the core "meta-pattern" of the C++ FAQ, it
 is also the core meta-pattern that is underneath most of the design patterns
 in the GOF book.  Put it this way: without that meta-pattern, the concepts
 of "programming by contract" and "proper inheritance" wouldn't make any
 sense.

 The point is this: (1) the technique you want to describe is a good
 technique; and (2) it is thoroughly discussed in the literature (the GOF
 book, the C++ FAQ (both "lite" and "book" variants), most of the other
 "design patterns" stuff, and even the Eiffel literature (Bertrand Meyers et
 al)).

 One more thing: you probably want to check out the section on "proper
 inheritance."  Since you're using dynamic binding the way it was intended to
 be used, you must become an evangelist for "proper inheritance."  Work a few
 examples and you'll immediately see what I'm talking about.  I believe the
 C++ FAQ lite gives the ostrich/bird example, and perhaps the circle/ellipse
 example.  If we accept that a major design goal is to NOT have to change the
 "library code" (the pre-existing code that uses base-class-pointers) every
 time somebody adds a new derived class, then the value of proper inheritance
 becomes clear.

 Put it this way: one shouldn't create a derived class to *reuse* the stuff
 in the base class; one should create a derived class to *be reused* by the
 code that uses base-class-pointers.  It's a totally opposite way of looking
 at things - it's "right side up" but most people are "upside down."
