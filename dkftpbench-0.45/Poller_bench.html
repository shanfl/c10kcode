<h2><a name="goal">Goal</a></h2>
Various mechanisms of handling multiple sockets with a single server
thread are available; not all mechanisms are available on all platforms.
A C++ class, Poller, has been written which abstracts these mechanisms into a
common interface, and should provide both high performance and portability.
This microbenchmark compares the performance of select(), poll(), kqueue(), and /dev/poll
using Poller on Solaris 7, Linux 2.2.14, Linux 2.4.0-test10-pre4, and FreeBSD 4.x-STABLE.
<p>
Note that this is a synthetic microbenchmark, not a real world benchmark.
In the real world, other effects often swamp the kinds of things
measured here.

<h2><a name="desc">Description</a></h2>

Poller and Poller_bench are GPL'd software; you can
<a href="../dkftpbench/">download the source</a> 
or <a href="doc/Poller.html">view the doc online</a>.

<p>
Poller_bench sets up an array of socketpairs, has a Poller monitor
the read end of each socketpair, and measures how long it takes to execute
the following snippet of code with various styles of Poller:
<pre>
    for (k=0; k&lt;num_active; k++)
        write(fdpairs[k * spacing + spacing/2][1], "a", 1);
    poller.waitAndDispatchEvents(0);
</pre>
where spacing = num_pipes / num_active.
<p>
<code>poller.waitAndDispatchEvents()</code> calls 
<code>poll()</code> or 
<code>ioctl(m_dpfd, DP_POLL, &amp;dopoll)</code>,
as appropriate, then calls an event handler for each ready socket.
<p>
The event handler for this benchmark just executes
<pre>
    read(event->fd, buf, 1);
</pre>


<h2><a name="setup.linux">Setup - Linux</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Download the /dev/poll patch from
<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/patches/">http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/patches/</a>.
Be careful to get the right version for your kernel; not all kernels are supported.
I used vanilla kernel 2.2.14.
<li>Apply the patch, configure your kernel to enable /dev/poll support
(with 'make menuconfig'), and rebuild the kernel.
<li>Create an entry in /dev for the /dev/poll driver with
<pre>cd /dev
mknod poll u 15 125
chmod 666 /dev/poll
</pre>
where 15 is MISC_MAJOR and 125 is DEVPOLL_MINOR from the kernel sources;
your MISC_MAJOR may differ, be sure to check 
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/major.h for the definition of MISC_MAJOR on your system.
<li>Create a symbolic link so the benchmark (which includes usr/include/sys/devpoll.h)
can be compiled:
<pre>cd /usr/include/asm
ln -s ../linux/devpoll.h</pre>
</ul>

<h2><a name="setup.solaris">Setup - Solaris</a></h2>

On Solaris 7, you may need to install a patch to get /dev/poll
(or at least to get it to work properly); it's standard in Solaris 8.
See also <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html#nb./dev/poll">my notes on /dev/poll</a>.
<p>
Also, a line near the end of /usr/include/sys/poll_impl.h
may need to be moved to get it to compile when included from C++ programs.

<h2><a name="procedure">Procedure</a></h2>
Download the dkftpbench source tarball from
<a href="http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/">
http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/</a> and unpack.

<p>
On Linux, if you want kernel profile results, boot with argument
'profile=2' to enable the kernel's builtin profiler.
<p>
Run the shell script Poller_bench.sh as follows:
<pre>
  su
  sh Poller_bench.sh
</pre>
<p>
The script raises file descriptor limits, then runs the command
<pre>
	./Poller_bench 5 1 spd 100 1000 10000 
</pre>
<p>
It should be run on an idle machine, with no email client,
web browser, or X server running.  The Pentium III machine
at my disposal was running a single sshd; the Solaris machine
was running two sshd's and an idle XWindow server, so it wasn't quite as idle.

<h2><a name="results">Results</a></h2>
With 1 active socket amongst 100, 1000, or 10000 total sockets,
waitAndDispatchEvents takes the following amount of wall-clock time, in microseconds
(lower is faster):

during test, and the test seemed to occupy only one CPU.)
<p>
On an idle 650 MHz dual Pentium III running Red Hat Linux 6.2
with kernel 2.2.14smp plus the /dev/poll patch plus <a href="close.patch">Dave Miller's
patch to speed up close()</a>:
<b>

(Note: the /dev/poll patch does not apply cleanly to recent 2.4.0-test kernels, I believe,
and I did not try it.)

<p>
On a single processor 600Mhz Pentium-III with 512MB of memory, running FreeBSD 4.x-STABLE
(results contributed by <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/~jlemon">Jonathan Lemon</a>):
<b>
<pre>
     pipes    100    1000    10000   30000
    select     54       -        -       -

    kqueue      8       8        8       8
</pre>
</b>

(Note: Jonathan also varied the number of <i>active</i>
pipes, and found that kqueue's time scaled linearly with
that number, whereas poll's time scaled linearly with
number of <i>total</i> pipes.)

<p>
The test was also run with pipes instead of socketpairs (results not shown);
the performance on Solaris was about the same, but the /dev/poll driver
on Linux did not perform well with pipes.  According to Niels Provos,
<blockquote><i>
The hinting code which causes a considerable speed up for /dev/poll only
applies to network sockets.  If there are any serious applications that
make uses of pipes in a manner that would benefit from /dev/poll then
the pipe code needs to return hints too.
</i></blockquote>

<h2><a name="discussion">Discussion</a></h2>
<h3>Miscellany</h3>
Running the benchmark was painfully slow on Solaris 7 because 
the time to create or close socketpairs was outrageous.  
Likewise, on unpatched 2.2.14, the time to close
socketpairs was outrageous, but the recent patch from Dave Miller
fixes that nicely.
<p>
2.4.0-test10-pre4 was slower than 2.2.14 in all cases tested.
<p>
I should show results for pipes as well as socketpairs.
<p>
The Linux 2.2.14 /dev/poll driver printed messages to the console
when sockets were closed; this should probably be disabled for production.

<h3>kqueue()</h3>
It looks offhand like kqueue() performs best of all the tested methods.
It's even faster than, and scales better than, /dev/poll, at least 
in this microbenchmark.

<h3>/dev/poll vs. poll</h3>
In all cases tested involving sockets, /dev/poll was appreciably faster than poll().
<p>
The 2.2.14 Linux /dev/poll driver was about six times faster than poll()
for 1000 fds, but fell down to only 2.7 times faster at 10000 fds.
The Solaris /dev/poll driver was about seven times faster than poll() at
100 fds, and increased to 40 times faster at 10000 fds.

<h3>Scalability of poll() and /dev/poll</h3>
Under Solaris 7, when the number of idle sockets was increased from 100 to 10000,
the time to check for active sockets with poll() and /dev/poll increased by a factor 
of only 6.5 (good) and 1.5 (fantastic), respectively.  
<p>
Under Linux 2.2.14, when the number of idle sockets was increased from 100 to 10000,
the time to check for active sockets with poll() and /dev/poll increased by a factor 
of 493 and 224, respectively.  This is terribly, horribly bad scaling behavior.
<p>
Under Linux 2.4.0-test10-pre4, when the number of idle sockets was increased from 100 to 10000,
the time to check for active sockets with poll() increased by a factor 
of 300.  This is terribly, horribly bad scaling behavior.
<p>
There seems to be a scalability problem in poll() under both Linux 2.2.14 and 2.4.0-test10-pre4
and in /dev/poll under Linux 2.2.14.  
<p>
poll() is stuck with an interface that dictates O(n) behavior on total pipes;
still, Linux's implementation could be improved.
The design of the current Linux /dev/poll patch is O(n) in total pipes, 
in spite of the fact that its interface allows it to be O(1) in total pipes
and O(n) only in <i>active</i> pipes.

<h2><a name="profiling">Results - kernel profiling</a></h2>
To look for the scalability problem, I added support to the
benchmark to trigger the Linux kernel profiler.  A few results
are shown below.  (No smoking gun was found, but then, I wouldn't
know a smoking gun if it hit me in the face.  Perhaps real kernel
hackers can pick up the hunt from here.)
<p>
If you run the above test on a Linux system booted with 'profile=2',
Poller_bench will output one kernel profiling data file per test condition.
Poller_bench.sh does a gross analysis using 'readprofile | sort -rn | head > bench%d%c.top'
to find the kernel functions with the highest CPU usage,
where %d is the number of socketpairs, and %c is p for poll, d for /dev/poll, etc.
<p>
'more bench10000*.top' shows the results for 10000 socketpairs.
On 2.2.14, it shows:
<pre>

   148 do_poll                                    0.6727
    24 sys_poll                                   0.0659
     7 __generic_copy_from_user                   0.1167
</pre>
This seems to indicate that /dev/poll spends nearly all of its time in dp_poll(),
and poll spends a fair bit of time in three routines: unix_poll, sock_poll, and do_poll.
<p>
On 2.4.0-test10-pre4 smp, 'more bench10000*.top' shows:

   209 fget                                       2.4881
   195 sock_poll                                  5.4167
    29 sys_poll                                   0.0342
    29 fput                                       0.1272
    29 do_pollfd                                  0.1648
</pre>

It seems curious that the idle routine should show up so much,
but it's probably just the second CPU doing nothing.

<p>
Poller_bench.sh will also try to do a fine analysis of dp_poll() using 
the 'profile' tool (source included), which is a variant of readprofile 
that shows hotspots within kernel functions.  Looking at its output for
the run on 2.2.14, the three four-byte regions that take up the most
CPU time in dp_poll() in the 10000 socketpair case are
<pre>
   c01d9158  39.135654%           326
   c01d9174  11.404561%            95
   c01d91a0  27.250900%           227
</pre>
Looking at the output of 'objdump -d /usr/src/linux/vmlinux', that
region corresponds to the object code:
<pre>
c01d9158:	c7 44 24 14 00 00 00 	movl   $0x0,0x14(%esp,1)
c01d915f:	00

c01d9179:	83 7c 24 14 00       	cmpl   $0x0,0x14(%esp,1)
c01d917e:	75 12                	jne    c01d9192 <dp_poll+0xde>
c01d9180:	53                   	push   %ebx
c01d9181:	ff 74 24 3c          	pushl  0x3c(%esp,1)
c01d9185:	e8 5a fc ff ff       	call   c01d8de4 <dp_delete>
c01d918a:	83 c4 08             	add    $0x8,%esp
c01d918d:	e9 d1 00 00 00       	jmp    c01d9263 <dp_poll+0x1af>
c01d9192:	8b 7c 24 10          	mov    0x10(%esp,1),%edi
c01d9196:	0f bf 4f 06          	movswl 0x6(%edi),%ecx
c01d919a:	31 c0                	xor    %eax,%eax
c01d919c:	f0 0f b3 43 10       	lock btr %eax,0x10(%ebx)
c01d91a1:	19 c0                	sbb    %eax,%eax
</pre>
I'm not yet familiar enough with kernel hacker tools to associate those
with lines of code in /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/devpoll.c, but
that 'lock btr' hotspot appears to be the call to test_and_clear_bit().
