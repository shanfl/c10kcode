<h1>Introduction to non-blocking I/O</h1>
Programs that use non-blocking I/O tend to follow the rule that
every function has to return immediately, i.e. all the functions
in such programs are nonblocking.
Thus control passes very quickly from one routine to the next.  
You have to understand the overall picture to some extent before any
one piece makes sense.
(This makes it harder to get your mind around than the same program
written with blocking calls, but the benefits mentioned elsewhere
in this document make up for this trouble, so don't be discouraged.)
<p>
Many objects need to wait for time to pass or for an external event to occur, 
but because their methods must return immediately, they can't do the obvious
or natural thing.  Instead, they use the "state machine" technique.
You might see this motif repeatedly throughout the code.
<p>
To illustrate this, let's consider a simple networking class that
lets you send a file to a remote machine, assuming the connection
is all set up.  Normally, you might write it like this:
<pre>
#define BUFSIZE 1024
class filesender_t {
public:
    /* Send a file on the given socket.
     * 'filename' is the name of the file to send.
     * 'socket' is an open network connection.
     * On exit, socket is closed.
     */
    void sendFile(const char *filename, int socket)
    {
        int fd;
        int nread; 
        int nwrite, i;
        char buf[BUFSIZE];

        /* Open the file */
        fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY);
        if (fd &lt; 0)
            fatal_error("open failed");

        /* Send the file, one chunk at a time */
        do {                                            /* loop in time! */
            /* Get one chunk of the file from disk */
            nread = read(fd, buf, BUFSIZE);
            if (nread == 0) {
                /* All done; close the file and the socket. */
                close(fd);
                close(socket);
                break;
            }

            /* Send the chunk */
            for (i=0; i&lt;nread; i += nwrite) {        /* loop in time! */
                /* write might not take it all in one call,
                 * so we have to try until it's all written
                 */
                nwrite = write(socket, buf + i, nread - i);
                if (nwrite &lt; 0) 
                    fatal_error("write failed");
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
But in the world of nonblocking programming, you can't do this, because 
it loops until some external event happens
(i.e. the socket accepts the whole file), which is a major no-no.
The work of that loop
has to be moved into a function that does a sliver of the work
on each call.  The main program agrees to ensure that this function is
called periodically.
The way you do this is turn the local variables of the loop into
member variables of the class, and the body of the loop into a method.
For instance:
<pre>
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Portable function to set a socket into nonblocking mode.
 Calling this on a socket causes all future read() and write() calls on
 that socket to do only as much as they can immediately, and return 
 without waiting.
 If no data can be read or written, they return -1 and set errno
 to EAGAIN (or EWOULDBLOCK).
 Thanks to Bjorn Reese for this code.

int setNonblocking(int fd)
{
    int flags;

    /* If they have O_NONBLOCK, use the Posix way to do it */
#if defined(O_NONBLOCK)
    /* Fixme: O_NONBLOCK is defined but broken on SunOS 4.1.x and AIX 3.2.5. */
    if (-1 == (flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0)))
        flags = 0;
    return fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
#else
    /* Otherwise, use the old way of doing it */
    flags = 1;
    return ioctl(fd, FIOBIO, &flags);
#endif
}     

#define BUFSIZE 1024
class filesender_t {
    int m_fd;               /* file being sent */
    char m_buf[BUFSIZE];    /* current chunk of file */
    int m_buf_len;          /* bytes in buffer */
    int m_buf_used;         /* bytes used so far; &lt;= m_buf_len */
    enum { IDLE, SENDING } m_state; /* what we're doing */

public:
    filesender() {
        m_state = IDLE;     /* not doing anything initially */
    }

    /* Start sending a file on the given socket.
     * Set the socket to be nonblocking.
     * 'filename' is the name of the file to send.
     * 'socket' is an open network connection.
     */
    void sendFile(const char *filename, int socket)
    {
        int nread; 
        int nwrite, i;

        /* Force the network socket into nonblocking mode */
        setNonblocking(socket);

        /* Open the file */
        m_fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY);
        if (m_fd &lt; 0)
            fatal_error("open failed");

        /* Start sending it */
        m_buf_len = 0;
        m_buf_used = 0;
        m_socket = socket;
        m_state = SENDING;
    }

    /* Continue sending the file started by sendFile().
     * Call this periodically.
     * Returns nonzero when done.
     */
    int handle_io()
    {
        if (m_state == IDLE)
            return 2;     /* nothing to do */

        /* If buffer empty, fill it */
        if (m_buf_used == m_buf_len) {
            /* Get one chunk of the file from disk */
            m_buf_len = read(m_fd, m_buf, BUFSIZE);
            if (m_buf_len == 0) {
                /* All done; close the file and the socket. */
                close(m_fd);
                close(m_socket);
                m_state = IDLE;
                return 1;
            }
            m_buf_used = 0;
        }

        /* Send one chunk of the file */
        assert(m_buf_len &gt; m_buf_used);
        nwrite = write(m_socket, m_buf + m_buf_used, m_buf_len - m_buf_used);
        if (nwrite &lt; 0) 
            fatal_error("write failed");
        m_buf_used += nwrite;
        return 0;
    }
}
</pre>
You can imagine the user code calling this in a simple loop, as in the following example,
which prints the file to stdout as if it were a network connection:
<pre>
main()
{
    filesender_t c;
    int sock = fileno(stdout);

    c.sendFile("foo.txt", sock);
    do {
        int done = c.handle_io();
        if (done) 
            break;
    }
}
</pre>
This may seem like a lot of work for nothing -- all we did was turn the
loop inside out -- but notice that you can now send multiple
files at the same time, e.g.
<pre>
#define MAXCLIENTS 10
main()
{
    filesender_t filesenders[MAXCLIENTS];
    int n_filesenders;
    int listenfd;
    struct sockaddr_in servaddr;

    /* Set up to be a daemon listening on port 8000 */
    listenfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    memset(&servaddr, 0, sizeof(servaddr));
    servaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    servaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
    servaddr.sin_port   = htons(8000);
    bind(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *) &servaddr, sizeof(servaddr));
    /* Force the network socket into nonblocking mode */
    setNonblocking(listenfd);

    /* Wait for connections, and send anyone who connects 
     * the contents of foo.txt
     */
    n_filesenders = 0;
    do {
        /* If we don't have a full set of clients already,
         * listen for a new connection.
         */
        if (n_filesenders &lt; MAXCLIENTS) {
            int fd = accept(listenfd, NULL, NULL);
            if (fd != -1) {
                /* Someone connected.  Send them the file */
                filesenders[n_filesenders].sendFile("foo.txt", fd);
                n_filesenders++;
            }
        }
        /* Pump data out to all the connected clients */
        for (int i=0; i&lt;n_filesenders; i++)
            filesenders[i].handle_io();
    }
}
</pre>
This example isn't very realistic, as it wastes CPU time, doesn't re-use the elements of
filesenders[] when they're done, and doesn't do enough error checking,
but you get the idea.
<p>
The next trick needed to get good performance out of this
approach is to use poll() to sleep until some file descriptor
is ready for I/O, and then call handle_io() on just that one
file descriptor.
