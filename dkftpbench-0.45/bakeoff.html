<h1>Linux FTP Server Performance Bakeoff</h1>

<h2>ftp.cdrom.com: the current champion</h2>
<i>How</i> does ftp.cdrom.com do it?  Their ftp server is 
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/press/wcarchive_milestone.phtml">said to be capable of handling 
ten thousand simultaneous downloads</a> -- with a 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/archive-info/configuration">single CPU and network interface</a>.
<p>
Their secret?  FreeBSD and a custom ftp server daemon.  It's time
that Linux and its bevy of ftp servers stood up to this challenge.

<h2>The Bakeoff</h2>
I plan to compare performance of FTP daemons for Linux in a kind
of performance bake-off sometime around March 2001.  Each daemon will
be subjected to a torture test to see how many simultaneous
dialup downloads it can support.  The results will be posted
publicly, and I'll send the author of the winning FTP daemon
a care package of homemade cookies :-)  There will be separate
categories for free and for commercial FTP daemons, and
for "Document Tree Smaller than System RAM" and "Document Tree
Larger than System RAM", so I'll be baking several batches of cookies.

<h2>Mailing List</h2>
If you're interested in participating, please join 
<a href="http://onelist.com/community/ftpbench">the mailing list</a>
and/or pipe up on <a href="news:comp.benchmarks">comp.benchmarks</a>.

<h2>Getting Your Daemon Ready</h2>
You can get ready for the bakeoff by testing your daemon yourself
to see how many users it can support, eliminating bottlenecks, lowering
memory consumption, and posting instructions on your daemon's support 
page for how to configure it and the OS to support, say, 1000 
simultaneous users.
The tests will probably be run with Red Hat Linux 6.2, hopefully
using the 2.4 kernel.
<p>
An early version of the load generator that will be used is
available now at 
<a href="index.html">http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/</a>
You can use it now to stress-test your daemon.  The load generator
will be more interesting by March, but it's usable as is now.

<h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
<a href="http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/results.html">Preliminary results</a>
with this load generator with a very small document tree
show ncftpd beating out wu-ftpd and proftpd, and betaftpd whipping them all.
Betaftpd won't do as well on the large document tree, though, since
it will slow to a crawl as soon as it has to hit the disk.
